# A Personal Arch Installation Guide

This is a personal guide so if you are lost and just found this guide from somewhere, I recommend you to read the official [`wiki`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide)!  This guide will focus on `systemd-boot`, `UEFI` and a guide if you want to encrypt your partition with `LUKS/LVM`. This guide exists so that I can remember a bunch of things when reinstalling `Archlinux`.

## Pre-installation

Before installing, make sure to:

+ Read the [official wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide). It is advisable to read that instead. I wrote this guide for myself.
+ Acquire an installation image from [here](https://www.archlinux.org/download/).
+ Verify signature.
+ Prepare an installation medium.
+ Boot the live environment.
